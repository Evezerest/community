# PaddlePaddle SIGs

PaddlePaddle projects have special interest groups operating in their repective ways. 

## PPOCR-SIG

PPOCR-SIG (PaddleOCR Special Interest Group) is committed to building a vibrant OCR community, and we welcome developers from all backgrounds to apply OCR to all walks of life in the spirit of open source, thereby improving our production efficiency.

At present, PPOCR-SIG has created PPOCRLabel semi-automatic annotation tools, OCR vertical applications (such as electricity meters), OCR C# deployment, "Dive into OCR" e-book and other classic applications, which have made important contributions to the prosperity of the PaddleOCR community. These projects are contained in the PaddleOCR [Community Project](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/release/2.6/doc/doc_ch/thirdparty.md) üèÖÔ∏è . Specific PPOCR-SIG sub-direction tasks are presented in PaddleOCR [Community Event](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/issues/4982) üéÅ ,which cover four categories, including documents, code, vertical models, and applications. This event is a score rank event for OCR community developers. 

You can choose to join PPOCR-SIG by registering the Community Event or [fill in the questionnaire](https://paddle.wjx.cn/vj/hoZnW83.aspx#) to discuss new insights with the group members.
